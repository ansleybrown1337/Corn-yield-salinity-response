I made this code for my graduate studies to look at reductions in corn yield
due to increased soil salinity.

The code takes yield and soil salinity data, expressed as the electrical
conductivity of the saturated paste extract (ECe) and fits yield-response curves
for accurate estimation of yield losses due to increased soil salinity.

It's not in a very clean format for anyone to use, but it is useful. If you are
interested in using this code, please contact me and I can help you get started.

Cheers,
AJ
